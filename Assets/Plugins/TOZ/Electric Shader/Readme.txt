RELEASE NOTES:
*-----------------------------------------------*
v2.0
* Folder structure changed.
* Shader improvements.

HOW TO USE:
*-----------------------------------------------*
Look at demo scene and appropriate material.
Add the material to any object and play with material properties.

HOW TO ADD THE EFFECT TO ANY OTHER SHADER:
*-----------------------------------------------*
Check the DiffuseDemoScene and Sample-Diffuse-Electric.shader file.
You will see a regular very simple surface diffuse shader with additional usepass directive,
and the electric shader properties.
If you do the same for any other shader, you will add the effect as a second pass on that one.
Beware that GPU instancing only works on first pass of any shader according to unity documents.

KNOWN ISSUES:
*-----------------------------------------------*
None
